## You [8:25:30 AM]

A sophisticated AI-powered image editing system using a "Director-Agent" architecture for natural language control of image elements. Features include spatial awareness (Grounding DINO + SAM 2), modular execution workers (IC-Light, GLIGEN, LaMa), and a Scene Graph Interface for element-based editing. The system translates natural language commands into structured JSON action plans for precise pixel manipulation.
